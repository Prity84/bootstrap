Bootstrap=> 

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web applications. It was originally created by Twitter developers and is now maintained by a community of developers.

Bootstrap provides a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more, which can be easily integrated into web projects. These components are designed to be responsive and mobile-first, meaning they adapt and look good on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

One of the key features of Bootstrap is its grid system, which allows developers to create responsive layouts by dividing a web page into rows and columns. This grid system helps in organizing content and ensuring that it displays properly across different devices.

Bootstrap also comes with pre-styled templates and themes, making it easier for developers to create visually appealing websites without having to write extensive CSS from scratch.

Overall, Bootstrap is widely used by developers to streamline the process of building responsive and attractive web interfaces.
